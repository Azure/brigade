# Brigade Documentation

Everything you need to know about Brigade.

If you haven't used Brigade before, welcome! ðŸŽ‰
Brigade 2.0 has a new design that makes learning and interacting with Brigade easier than ever before.
It is now a first-class experience that doesn't require familiarity with Kubernetes, so you can quickly be productive without a steep learning curve.

For those who are migrating from Brigade 1.0, while there are some breaking changes, overall it should feel familiar.
Migration instructions will be forthcoming in the coming weeks, so watch our [blog] or join us on the [#brigade channel][channel] on the [Kubernetes Slack][slack] for when that's available.

### First Steps

Try our [QuickStart] to install Brigade and walk through setting up your first project.
